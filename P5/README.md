### Sales Prediction Competition

My first Kaggle competition wherein the task was to predict sales given the time series data. The data is provided for the years 2013,2014 and 2015. The predictions need to be made for the sales of items for the month of November 2015. Fitting models on raw features, want lead to very promising results. For good performance, extra features needto be devised. Since, most of the features are categorical, using tree based models would be most suitable for predicting the target values.
